3. Place the **SCFA_Updater.exe** into the root of the Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance folder \*(i.e. C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance)\_
4. Make sure you have started Supreme Commander at least once in order to create a profile;
5. Start **SCFA_Updater.exe** and press the update button; (this can take up to 45 minutes on the first tun, it needs to pull in a lot of (big) files);
